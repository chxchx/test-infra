# A mapping of bucket URLs to bucket metadata.
#
# Possible bucket metadata:
#   contact: github name to contact
#   prefix: the identifier used for this bucket on the test-history dashboard.
#   sequential: an optional boolean that indicates whether test runs in this
#     bucket are numbered sequentially. This is used for an optimization in the
#     test-history collection phase, and defaults to true.
